# Navi_Bus
## RV University, Semester 2 Final project 
## Bus Tracking System
### A bus tracking system is used for tracking government buses every day. It gives the current location of a bus to its upcoming bus stop and interconnects multiple bus stops to update every user of a bus's location.

## Hardware requirements
- LoRa Ra-02        --> 2 pieces
- Neo gps module    --> 1 piece
- Arduino uno       --> 2 pieces
- Jumper Wires      --> 1 pack
- Bread Board       --> 2 pieces

## Software Requirements
- Arduino IDE (on at least 2 systems)
- TinyGPS+ module library
- SPI module library 
- LoRa module library


## Future enhancements
- To make a website/app that allows users to acess bus timings from anywhere.
